üßë‚Äçüéì Geophysicist interested in natural hazards, numerical simulations, and data science. I have experience in tsunami simulations and seismic wave propagation in complex media across different scales (regional and global). I apply statistical tools to earthquake rupture forecasting utilizing deterministic earthquake simulators. I have a deep understanding of probabilistic seismic(and tsunami) hazard models, as well as full waveform tomography.

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at USC and I am actively collaborating with Qingkai Kong at LLNL on FWI with Fourier Neural Operators. I will join Martin Mai's group at KAUST later this year.


Research
======
1) Earthquake forecasting
   
I manipulate earthquake numerical simulations (complex spatio-temporal slip distributions) like RSQSim-type generated catalogs to draw statistical insights of earthquake predictability.

I do not do this in a deterministic way, but I employ Bayesian methods to update prior earthquake rupture forecasts. Specifically, I update the time-independent model of the Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast, Version 3 (UCERF3) of Field et al. (2014).

Where does my data to update UCERF3 come from? Long-multicycle earthquake simulations based on the physics of earthquakes! (RSQSim model)

2) Full-waveform tomography

I solve the  elasto-dynamic wave equation to study seismic propagation across different scales, regional and global.

Regional Scale: Southern California

Global Scale: Planet earth (Mars would be nice too!)
