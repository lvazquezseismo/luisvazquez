üßë‚Äçüéì Geophysicist interested in natural hazards, numerical simulations, and data science. I have experience in tsunami simulations and seismic wave propagation in complex media across different scales (regional and global). I apply statistical tools to earthquake rupture forecasting utilizing deterministic earthquake simulators. I have a deep understanding of probabilistic seismic(and tsunami) hazard models, as well as full waveform tomography.

Currently, I am in the last year of my doctoral studies at the University of Southern California under the supervision of Prof. Thomas H. Jordan. However, I am interested in future positions in the natural hazard and risk fields, and in HPC simulation applying conventional (finite difference or finite element) methos as well as Fourier Neural Operators to solve PDEs.


Research
======
1) Earthquake forecasting
   
I manipulate earthquake numerical simulations (complex spatio-temporal slip distributions) like RSQSim-type generated catalogs to draw statistical insights of earthquake predictability.

I do not do this in a deterministic way, but I employ Bayesian methods to update prior earthquake rupture forecasts. Specifically, I update the time-independent model of the Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast, Version 3 (UCERF3) of Field et al. (2014).

Where does my data to update UCERF3 come from? Long-multicycle earthquake simulations based on the physics of earthquakes! (RSQSim model)

2) Full-waveform tomography

I solve the  elasto-dynamic wave equation to study seismic propagation across different scales, regional and global.

Regional Scale: Southern California



Global Scale: Planet earth (Mars would be nice too!)
